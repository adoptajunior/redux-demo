# MERN PROJECT

MERN is a pre-built technology stack based on JavaScript technologies. MERN stands for: MongoDB, Express, React, and Node, after the four key technologies that make up the stack.

- MongoDB — document database
- Express(.js) — Node.js web framework
- React(.js) — a client-side JavaScript framework
- Node(.js) — the premier JavaScript web server (runtime)

Express and Node make up the middle (application) tier. Express.js is a server-side web framework, and Node.js is the popular and powerful JavaScript server platform. Regardless of which variant you choose, ME(RVA)N is the ideal approach to working with JavaScript and JSON, all the way through.
